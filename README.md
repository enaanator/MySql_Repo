# HR Data Analytics Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analytics project focused on Human Resource (HR) data analysis. The project utilizes MySQL for data storage and manipulation, and PowerBI for data visualization.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze HR data for a brand, leveraging SQL queries in MySQL and visualizing the results using PowerBI. The project follows the following workflow:

1. Data Loading: The HR data is initially loaded from a CSV file into a MySQL database. This allows for structured storage and efficient querying.

2. Data Cleaning: SQL queries are used to clean the HR data. Any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers are addressed during this stage to ensure data quality.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): SQL queries are further employed to perform EDA on the cleaned dataset. Various insights and patterns within the HR data are explored, helping gain a better understanding of the workforce.

4. Visualization: Result sets obtained from SQL queries are visualized using PowerBI. Interactive dashboards and reports are created to present the analyzed HR data in a visually appealing and insightful manner.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the HR data in CSV format.
- `scripts/`: Contains SQL scripts for data loading, cleaning, and EDA.
- `visualizations/`: Contains the PowerBI files (.pbix) for the visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies

- MySQL: Used for data storage and manipulation.
- PowerBI: Used for data visualization.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-data-analytics.gi

2. Set up a MySQL database and import the HR data from the CSV file provided in the `data/` directory.

3. Execute the SQL scripts in the `scripts/` directory to clean the data and perform EDA.

4. Connect PowerBI to the MySQL database and import the result sets from the SQL queries.

5. Use PowerBI to create interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards based on the imported data.
